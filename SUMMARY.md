- **Migration Strategy Document** (`MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md`)
  - Phased 8-week implementation plan
  - Risk mitigation strategies
  - Rollback procedures
  - Success metrics

### 2. Technical Implementation
- **SQL Extraction Scripts** (`/exports/sql_scripts/`)
  - Customer extraction with business/person account logic
  - Product catalog with inventory levels
  - Transaction history (2-year window)
  
- **Data Transformation Code** (`transform_data.py`)
  - Phone number standardization
  - Email validation
  - Currency formatting
  - Date/time conversions
  - CSV generation for Data Loader

- **Salesforce Metadata** (`/salesforce-metadata/force-app/`)
  - Custom field definitions
  - External ID configurations
  - Required for data relationships

### 3. Data Mapping & Documentation
- **Field Mapping Spreadsheet** (`/exports/DATA_MAPPING_ARALCO_TO_SALESFORCE.csv`)
  - 60+ field mappings across all objects
  - Transformation rules
  - Data type specifications

- **Data Dictionary** (`DATA_DICTIONARY.md`)
  - Comprehensive field documentation
  - Business rules and validations
  - Error handling procedures

### 4. Implementation Guides
- **Migration Runbook** (`MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md`)
  - Step-by-step execution instructions
  - Validation checkpoints
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Go-live checklist

- **Data Loader Configuration** (`/dataloader/process-conf.xml`)
  - Pre-configured for all objects
  - Batch processing settings
  - Error handling setup

### 5. Validation Tools
- **Post-Migration Validation** (`/validation/post_migration_validation.sql`)
  - Record count verification
  - Financial reconciliation
  - Data integrity checks
  - Relationship validation

## Key Findings & Recommendations

### Data Quality Insights
1. **Email Coverage**: Only 30% of customers have email addresses
   - **Recommendation**: Implement email capture campaign post-migration

2. **Data Standardization**: Phone numbers and addresses need formatting
   - **Solution**: Transformation scripts handle standardization

3. **No Foreign Keys**: Database uses application-level relationships
   - **Solution**: External IDs maintain referential integrity

### Salesforce Configuration Requirements
1. **Enable Person Accounts** for individual customers
2. **Create Record Types**: Business Account, Person Account, Vendor
3. **Deploy Custom Fields** before data load
4. **Configure External IDs** for upsert operations
5. **Set up Custom Objects**: Store__c for locations

### Migration Approach
- **Recommended**: Phased migration over 8 weeks
- **Alternative**: Big Bang possible but higher risk
- **Critical Success Factor**: Thorough testing in sandbox first

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Review and approve** migration strategy with stakeholders
2. **Set up Salesforce sandbox** environment
3. **Deploy custom metadata** using provided package
4. **Configure integration user** with appropriate permissions
5. **Schedule kick-off meeting** with migration team

### Pre-Migration Tasks (Week 2)
1. **Run SQL extraction scripts** against Aralco database
2. **Execute transformation scripts** to prepare data
3. **Load test batch** (100 records) to sandbox
4. **Validate test results** using provided queries
5. **Adjust mappings** if needed based on results

### Migration Execution (Weeks 3-7)
1. **Follow Migration Runbook** step-by-step
2. **Load data in sequence**: Accounts → Products → Orders
3. **Validate after each phase** using validation scripts
4. **Document any issues** for resolution
5. **Conduct UAT** with business users

### Go-Live (Week 8)
1. **Final data extraction** from Aralco
2. **Production deployment** over weekend
3. **Execute validation suite**
4. **User training** and support
5. **Monitor system** performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Loss**: Mitigated by validation scripts and external IDs
- **Performance**: Batch processing and off-hours migration
- **Integration**: Comprehensive testing in sandbox

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Training materials and support plan needed
- **Data Quality**: Cleansing rules implemented in transformation
- **Business Continuity**: Rollback procedures documented
