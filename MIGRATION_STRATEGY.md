# Aralco POS to Salesforce Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for migrating data from Aralco POS system to Salesforce Sales Cloud. The migration involves 13,111 customers, 37,028 products, and 37,677 transactions with a phased approach to ensure data integrity and business continuity.

## 1. Migration Overview

  - Inventory: 19,611 records across multiple stores
  - Suppliers: 266 records

### 1.2 Key Objectives
1. Maintain data integrity and relationships
2. Enable seamless business operations post-migration
3. Preserve historical transaction data
4. Establish bi-directional sync capability for future

## 2. Data Architecture Mapping

- `Subtotal__c` (Currency)
- `Tax_1__c` (Currency)
- `Tax_2__c` (Currency)
- `Discount_Amount__c` (Currency)
- `Payment_Method__c` (Picklist)

## 3. Migration Approach

### 3.1 Recommended Strategy: Phased Migration

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- Deploy Salesforce metadata (custom objects, fields, page layouts)
- Set up integration user and permissions
- Configure data loader and integration tools
- Create validation rules and duplicate rules

**Phase 2: Master Data (Week 3-4)**
- Migrate Stores
- Migrate Customer Groups
- Migrate Suppliers (as Vendor Accounts)
- Migrate Products and Price Books

**Phase 3: Customer Data (Week 5)**
- Migrate Business Accounts
- Migrate Person Accounts
- Validate customer data integrity
- Set up customer hierarchies

**Phase 4: Transactional Data (Week 6-7)**
- Migrate historical orders (last 2 years)
- Migrate order line items
- Validate financial totals
- Set up reporting snapshots

**Phase 5: Go-Live (Week 8)**
- Final data validation
- User training
- Cutover weekend
- Post-migration support

## 4. Data Quality Considerations

### 4.1 Identified Issues
1. **Missing Email Addresses**: Only ~30% of customers have email addresses
2. **Incomplete Names**: Some customers have missing first/last names
3. **No Foreign Keys**: Database relies on application-level relationships
4. **Data Standardization**: Phone numbers and addresses need formatting

### 4.2 Data Cleansing Rules
1. **Phone Numbers**: Standardize to (XXX) XXX-XXXX format
2. **Emails**: Validate format and lowercase
3. **Addresses**: Standardize province codes and country names
4. **Names**: Generate "Unknown Customer {ID}" for missing names
5. **Dates**: Convert to Salesforce format (YYYY-MM-DD)

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 ETL Process
1. **Extract**: SQL scripts to export data in CSV format
2. **Transform**: Python scripts for data cleansing and formatting
3. **Load**: Salesforce Data Loader for bulk operations

### 5.2 Integration Architecture

```

### 5.3 External ID Strategy
- Use Aralco IDs as external IDs for upsert operations
- Maintain mapping tables for relationship preservation
- Enable easy rollback and data reconciliation

## 6. Validation & Testing

### 6.1 Validation Checkpoints
1. **Record Counts**: Source vs Target comparison
2. **Financial Totals**: Transaction amounts reconciliation
3. **Relationship Integrity**: Customer-Order associations
4. **Data Completeness**: Required field population
5. **Business Rules**: Validate calculations and formulas

### 6.2 Test Scenarios
1. Customer lookup by various criteria
2. Order history retrieval
3. Product inventory accuracy
4. Report generation
5. Integration user access

## 7. Rollback Plan

### 7.1 Rollback Strategy
1. Maintain source system operational during migration
2. Keep transformation audit logs
3. Use external IDs for easy data deletion
4. Backup Salesforce metadata before changes
5. Document all customizations

### 7.2 Rollback Procedure
1. Deactivate integration users
2. Delete migrated data using external IDs
3. Restore original Salesforce configuration
4. Revert to Aralco POS operations
5. Analyze issues and replan

## 8. Post-Migration

### 8.1 Success Metrics
- 100% customer data migrated
- 100% product catalog available
- 2 years of transaction history
- Zero data loss
- Business operations continuity

### 8.2 Ongoing Sync Options
1. **Real-time Integration**: Using Salesforce Connect
2. **Batch Sync**: Scheduled data transfers
3. **Event-Driven**: Webhook-based updates
4. **Manual Export/Import**: For periodic updates

## 9. Risk Mitigation

### 9.1 Identified Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data Loss | High | Multiple backups, validation scripts |
| Relationship Breaks | High | External ID mapping, thorough testing |
| Performance Issues | Medium | Batch processing, off-hours migration |
| User Adoption | Medium | Training, documentation, support |
| Integration Failures | Low | Retry mechanisms, error handling |

## 10. Next Steps

1. Review and approve migration strategy
2. Set up Salesforce sandbox environment
3. Deploy custom metadata
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Schedule stakeholder training
